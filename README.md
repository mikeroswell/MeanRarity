# MeanRarity
Repo for development of mean rarity(and maybe also checkplot) R packages

Starting with code from existing projects copied into this repo. Slowly going to go through to check and clean functions, perhaps test and optimize a bit, and then document and provide vignettes This is new to me and going to work through online resources to get it together.
