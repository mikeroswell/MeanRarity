abstract = {* The compositional complexity of an assemblage is not expressible as a single number; standard measures such as diversities (Hill numbers) and entropies (R{\'{e}}nyi entropies and Tsallis entropies) vary in their order q which determines the measures' emphasis on rare or common species. Ranking and comparing assemblages depend on the choice of q. Rather than selecting one or a few measures to describe an assemblage, it is preferable to convey the complete story by presenting a continuous profile, a plot of diversity or entropy as a function of q ≥ 0. This makes it easy to visually compare the compositional complexities of multiple assemblages and to judge the evenness of the relative abundance distributions of the assemblages. In practice, the profile is plotted for all values of q from 0 to q = 3 or 4 (beyond which it generally changes little). * These profiles are usually generated by substituting species sample proportions into the complexity measures. However, this empirical approach typically underestimates the true profile for low values of q, because samples usually miss some of the assemblage's species due to under-sampling. Although bias-reduction methods exist for individual measures of order q = 0, 1 and 2, there has been no analytic method that unifies these bias-corrected estimates into a continuous profile. * For incomplete sampling data, this work proposes a novel analytic method to obtain accurate, continuous, low-bias diversity and entropy profiles with focus on low orders of q (0 ≤ q ≤ 3). Our approach is based on reformulating the diversity and entropy of any order q in terms of the successive discovery rates of new species with respect to sample size, that is the successive slopes of the species accumulation curve. A bootstrap method is applied to obtain approximate variances of our proposed profiles and to construct the associated confidence intervals. * Extensive simulations from theoretical models and real surveys show that the proposed profiles greatly reduce under-sampling bias and have substantially lower bias and mean-squared error than the empirical profile, especially for q ≤ 1. Our method is also extended to deal with incidence data.},

@article{Botta-Dukat2018a,
abstract = {The replication principle was first proposed by Hill (1973, Ecology 54: 247– 432) as an advantageous property of his family of diversity indices. Later Jost (2007, Ecology 88: 2427– 2439) discovered that diversity measures satisfying this principle allow partitioning of gamma diversity into independent alpha and beta components by simple multiplicative partitioning. Despite the emerging agreement on measuring taxonomic beta-diversity by multiplicative partitioning of Hill diversity, there is no consensus on how to measure functional beta diversity. Two different generalizations of Hill numbers for measuring functional diversity were proposed by Leinster and Cobbold (2011, Ecology 93: 477– 489) and Chiu and Chao (2014, PLoS One 9: e1000014). Both generalizations attempted to satisfy the generalized replication principle, but they formulate it in different ways. The aims of this paper are 1) to review approaches for measuring functional diversity in units of equivalent numbers without explicit reference to replication principle; 2) to compare the two proposed replication principle and to point out some important differences in the behavior of diversity families derived from the two principles; 3) to explore the conditions necessary for partitioning functional diversity of Leinster and Cobbold into meaningful alpha and beta components; 4) and, finally, to explore how transformation of among-species distances into similarities influences the sensitivity of functional diversity to the scale parameter.},

@article{Beguinot2018a,
abstract = {The total number of co-occurring species (" true species richness ") and the way their respective abundances are distributed (" species abundance distribution ") are two major descriptive traits of species assemblages, in numerical terms. Moreover, beyond mere description, the species abundance distribution may help to infer how ecological factors/constraints are currently shaping the hierarchical structure of species assemblages and thereby, may contribute to shed light upon general traits regarding the functional organisation within communities of species. Unfortunately, both total species richness and exhaustive abundance distributions are not available when dealing with more or less incomplete species inventories, a situation which becomes increasingly frequent with the generalisation of the so-called " quick surveys " and " rapid biodiversity assessments " , which are almost unavoidable when addressing very species-rich assemblages, such as, for example, invertebrate communities. Hence, the necessity of extrapolating with minimum bias (i) the species accumulation curve, thereby deriving reliable estimates of the total species richness of sampled assemblage and (ii) the species abundance distribution to get an exhaustive pattern including the Method Article B{\'{e}}guinot; AIR, 13(4): 1-24, 2018; Article no.AIR.39002 2 full set of co-occurring species. Previous reports from the same author already dealt with the least-biased extrapolation of species accumulation and the associated derivation of total species richness. Now, an appropriate method is proposed, hereafter, to extrapolate with minimum bias the Species Abundance Distribution itself, when having to deal with only partial species inventories. The method shares in part some theoretical results that had already served to support the extrapolation of species accumulation process. The procedure leading to the extrapolation of the Species Abundance Distribution is first detailed in principle and then put into practice utilising a few examples. Improvements as compared to an earlier attempt at the same goal are discussed.},

However, it requires having an appropriate framework to measure network diversity locally, regionally and between samples ($\alpha$‐, $\gamma$‐ and $\beta$‐diversity). Here, we propose a unifying framework that builds on Hill numbers and accounts both for the probabilistic nature of biotic interactions and the abundances of species or groups. We emphasise the importance of analysing network diversity across different species aggregation levels (e.g. from species to trophic groups) to get a better understanding of network structure. We illustrate our framework with a simulation experiment and an empirical analysis using a global food‐web database. We discuss further usages of the framework and show how it responds to recent calls on comparing ecological networks and analysing their variation across environmental gradients and time.},

@article{Chao2012a,
abstract = {We propose an integrated sampling, rarefaction, and extrapolation methodology to compare species richness of a set of communities based on samples of equal completeness (as measured by sample coverage) instead of equal size. Traditional rarefaction or extrapolation to equal-sized samples can misrepresent the relationships between the richnesses of the communities being compared because a sample of a given size may be sufficient to fully characterize the lower diversity community, but insufficient to characterize the richer community. Thus, the traditional method systematically biases the degree of differences between community richnesses. We derived a new analytic method for seamless coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation. We show that this method yields less biased comparisons of richness between communities, and manages this with less total sampling effort. When this approach is integrated with an adaptive coverage-based stopping rule during sampling, samples may be compared directly without rarefaction, so no extra data is taken and none is thrown away. Even if this stopping rule is not used during data collection, coverage-based rarefaction throws away less data than traditional size-based rarefaction, and more efficiently finds the correct ranking of communities according to their true richnesses. Several hypothetical and real examples demonstrate these advantages.},

abstract = {Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number qD, where q = 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number qD, q > 0) and present a unified approach for both individual-based (abundance) data and samplebased (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers: q = 0 (species richness), q = 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and q = 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, S{\o}rensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita -Horn index as special cases. What},

We present the merits of information measures for describing and forecasting molecular variation within and among groups, comparing forecasts with data, and evaluating underlying processes such as dispersal.

abstract = {Quantifying diversity is of central importance for the study of structure, function and evolution of microbial communities. The estimation of microbial diversity has received renewed attention with the advent of large-scale metagenomic studies. Here, we consider what the diversity observed in a sample tells us about the diversity of the community being sampled. First, we argue that one cannot reliably estimate the absolute and relative number of microbial species present in a community without making unsupported assumptions about species abundance distributions. The reason for this is that sample data do not contain information about the number of rare species in the tail of species abundance distributions. We illustrate the difficulty in comparing species richness estimates by applying Chao's estimator of species richness to a set of in silico communities: they are ranked incorrectly in the presence of large numbers of rare species. Next,we extend our analysis to a general family of diversitymetrics (‘Hill diversities'), and construct lower and upper estimates of diversity values consistent with the sample data. The theory generalizes Chao's estimator, which we retrieve as the lower estimate of species richness.We show that Shannon and Simpson diversity can be robustly estimated for the in silico communities. We analyze nine metagenomic data sets from a wide range of environments, and show that our findings are relevant for empirically-sampled communities. Hence, we recommend the use of Shannon and Simpson diversity rather than species richness in efforts to quantify and compare microbial diversity.},

However, GST necessarily approaches zero when gene diversity is high, even if subpopulations are completely differentiated, and it is not monotonic with increasing differentiation. Likewise, when diversity is equated with heterozygosity, standard similarity measures formed by taking the ratio of mean within-subpopulation diversity to total diversity necessarily approach unity when diversity is high, even if the subpopulations are completely dissimilar (no shared alleles). None of these measures can be interpreted as measures of differentiation or similarity. The derivations of these measures contain two subtle misconceptions which cause their paradoxical behaviours. Conclusions about population differentiation, gene flow, relatedness, and conservation priority will often be wrong when based on these fixation indices or similarity measures. These are not statistical issues; the problems persist even when true population frequencies are used in the calculations. Recent advances in the mathematics of diversity identify the misconceptions, and yield mathematically consistent descriptive measures of population structure which eliminate the paradoxes produced by standard measures. These measures can be directly related to the migration and mutation rates of the finite-island model. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author.},

abstract = {Aim: The island species–area relationship (ISAR) quantifies how the number of species increases as the area of an island or island-like habitat gets larger and is one of the most general patterns in ecology. However, studies that measure the ISAR often confound variation in sampling methodology and analyses, precluding appropriate syntheses of its underlying mechanisms. Most ISAR studies use only presence–absence data at the whole-island scale, whereas we planned to use a framework that applies individual-based rarefaction to synthesize whether and how the ISAR differs from the null expectation of the passive sampling hypothesis. Location: Five hundred and five islands from 34 different archipelagos across the world, including oceanic islands, lake islands and forest islands. Major taxa studied: Local assemblages of plants, invertebrates, herpetofauna, birds and mammals. Methods: We collated local-scale species abundance data from multiple archipelagos (median of 12 islands per study) and used a rarefaction-based approach to synthesize the relationship between island size and (1) sample effort-controlled rarefied species richness, or (2) an effective number of species derived from the probability of interspecific encounter (an index of community evenness). Results: When we applied rarefaction to control for sampling effort, the numbers of species and their relative abundances across all studies differed from the passive sampling hypothesis. Our measure of evenness also increased with island size, suggesting that the disproportionate effects we observed influenced both rarer and more common species. We found few associations between the slope of this effect and island type or taxon, but we did find that island archipelagos with greater elevational heterogeneity also deviated more from the null expectation than those with less heterogeneity. Main conclusions: Using a synthetic approach across island archipelagos, we reject the null expectation that passive sampling causes the ISAR and instead suggest that ecological mechanisms leading to disproportionate (non-random) effects on larger relative to smaller islands are predominant.},

@article{Chao2016,
abstract = {1.There are many concepts and measures of beta diversity and related similarity/differentiation indices. The variance framework (derived from the total variance of a community species abundance matrix) and diversity decomposition (based on partitioning gamma diversity into alpha and beta components) are two major approaches. 2.There have been no bridges/links between the two approaches. Here we establish a bridge by extending and modifying each approach so that both lead to the same classes of similarity/differentiation measures, which range in the interval [0, 1] and which can be compared across multiple sets of communities. 3.Our extension/modification in each approach is based on the following major differences between the two approaches. (i) In the decomposition approach, a diversity order q that controls sensitivity to species abundances is used, whereas there is no such order involved in the variance approach. (ii) Transformations of raw abundances are typically used in the variance approach, whereas abundances are not transformed in diversity decomposition. (iii) The variance-based beta for non-transformed data is implicitly related to (and constrained by) alpha, gamma and total abundance. Namely, the attained maximum value of this beta when communities are completely distinct (no shared species) is not a fixed constant; the maximum varies with alpha, gamma and total abundance. By contrast, the beta component obtained from the multiplicative decomposition is not constrained by alpha, gamma and total abundance. 4.To construct the bridge, we extend the variance of community data to a class of divergence measures (parameterized by an order q) and use normalization to remove these measures' constraints by alpha, gamma and total abundance. The resulting normalized divergence measures are legitimate differentiation measures. In the decomposition approach, we adopt a modified multiplicative decomposition scheme; the resulting beta component can be transformed to quantify compositional similarity/differentiation among communities. Then the similarity/differentiation measures obtained from the extended variance framework turn out to be identical to those from the modified diversity decomposition, establishing the bridge. 5.Other types of similarity/differentiation measures (e.g., N-community Bray-Curtis type) and extension to phylogenetic and functional versions are discussed.

@article{Roswell2021,
abstract = {Three metrics of species diversity-species richness, the Shannon index, and the Simpson index-are still widely used in ecology, despite decades of valid critiques leveled against them. Developing a robust diversity metric has been challenging because, unlike many variables ecologists measure, the diversity of a community often cannot be estimated in an unbiased way based on a random sample from that community. Over the past decade, ecologists have begun to incorporate two important tools for estimating diversity, coverage and Hill diversity. Coverage is a method for equalizing samples that is, on theoretical grounds, preferable to other commonly used methods such as equal-effort sampling, or rarefying datasets to equal sample size. Hill diversity comprises a spectrum of diversity metrics and is based on three key insights. First, species richness and variants of the Shannon and Simpson indices are all special cases of one general equation. Second, richness, Shannon, and Simpson can be expressed on the same scale and in units of species. Third, there is no way to eliminate the effect of relative abundance from estimates of any of these diversity metrics, including species richness. Rather, a researcher must choose the relative sensitivity of the metric towards rare and common species, a concept which we describe as "leverage." In this paper we explain coverage and Hill diversity, provide guidelines for how to use them together to measure species diversity, and demonstrate their use with examples from our own data. We show why researchers will obtain more robust results when they estimate the Hill diversity of equal-coverage samples, rather than using other methods such as equal-effort sampling or traditional sample rarefaction.

abstract = {Background: Intraspecific variation in foraging niche can drive food web dynamics and ecosystem pro- cesses. In particular, male and female animals can exhibit different, often cascading, impacts on their interaction partners. Despite this, studies of plant-pollinator interaction net- works have focused on the partitioning of the floral community between pollinator species, with little attention paid to intraspecific variation in plant preference between male and female bees. We designed a field study to evaluate the strength and prevalence of sexually dimorphic foraging, and particularly resource preferences, in bees. Study design: We observed bees visiting flowers in semi-natural meadows in New Jersey, USA. To detect differences in flower use against a shared background of resource (flower) availability, we maximized the number of interactions observed within narrow spatio-temporal windows. To distinguish observed differences in bee use of flower species, which can reflect abundance patterns and sampling effects, from underlying differences in bee preferences, we analyzed our data with both a permutation-based null model and random effects models. Findings: We found that the diets of male and female bees of the same species were often dissimilar as the diets of different species of bees. Furthermore, we demonstrate differences in prefer- ence between male and female bees. We show that intraspecific differences in preference can be robustly identified among hundreds of unique species-species interactions, without precisely quantifying resource availability, and despite high phenological turnover of both bees and plant bloom. Given the large differences in both flower use and preferences between male and female bees, ecological sex differences should be integrated into studies of bee demography, plant pollination, and coevolutionary relationships between flowers and insects.},

abstract = {Motivated by accelerating anthropogenic extinctions, decades of biodiversity–ecosystem function (BEF) experiments show that ecosystem function declines with species loss from local communities. Yet, at the local scale, changes in species' total and relative abundances are more common than species loss. The consensus best biodiversity measures are Hill numbers, which use a scaling parameter, ℓ , to emphasize rarer versus more common species. Shifting that emphasis captures distinct, function-relevant biodiversity gradients beyond species richness. Here, we hypothesized that Hill numbers that emphasize rare species more than richness does may distinguish large, complex and presumably higher-functioning assemblages from smaller and simpler ones. In this study, we tested which values of ℓ produce the strongest BEF relationships in community datasets of ecosystem functions provided by wild, free-living organisms. We found that ℓ values that emphasized rare species more than richness does most often correlated most strongly with ecosystem functions. As emphasis shifted to more common species, BEF correlations were often weak and/or negative. We argue that unconventional Hill diversities that shift emphasis towards rarer species may be useful for describing biodiversity change, and that employing a wide spectrum of Hill numbers can clarify mechanisms underlying BEF relationships.},

@article{Tuomisto2010a,
abstract = {The prevailing terminological confusion around the concept 'diversity' has hampered accurate communication and caused diversity issues to appear unnecessarily complicated. In fact, a consistent terminology for phenomena related to (species) diversity is already available. When this terminology is adhered to, diversity emerges as an easily understood concept. It is important to differentiate between diversity itself and a diversity index: an index of something is just a surrogate for the thing itself. The conceptual problem of defining diversity also has to be separated from the practical problem of deciding how to adequately quantify diversity for a community of interest. In practice, diversity can be quantified for any dataset where units of observation (such as individuals) have been classified into types (such as species). All that needs to be known is what proportion of the observed units belong to a type of mean abundance. Diversity equals the inverse of this mean, and it quantifies the effective number of the types of interest. In ecology, interest often (but not always) focuses on species diversity. If the dataset consists of (or gets divided into) subunits, then the total effective number of species (gamma diversity) can be partitioned into the effective number of compositionally distinct subunits (beta diversity) and the mean effective number of species per such subunit (alpha diversity). Species richness is related to species diversity, but they are not the same thing; richness does not take the proportional abundances into account and is therefore the actual-rather than the effective-number of types. Most of the phenomena that have been called 'beta diversity' in the past do not quantify an effective number of types, so they should be referred to by names other than 'diversity' (for example, species turnover or differentiation).},

@article{Chao2019a,
abstract = {An enormous number of measures based on different criteria have been proposed to quantify evenness or unevenness among species relative abundances in an assemblage. However, a unified approach that can encompass most of the widely‐used indices is still lacking. Here we first present some basic requirements for an evenness measure. We then propose that unevenness among species relative abundances in an assemblage can be measured by a normalized divergence between the vector of species relative abundances and the mean vector, where the mean vector represents the species relative abundances of a completely‐even assemblage. Thus, evenness among species relative abundances is measured by the corresponding normalized extent of closeness between the above two vectors. We consider five divergence measures, leading to five classes of evenness indices. All our evenness measures are in terms of diversity (Hill number) of order q > 0 (here q controls the weighting of species relative abundances) and species richness (diversity of order q = 0). We propose quantifying evenness through a continuous profile which depicts evenness as a function of diversity order q > 0. The profiles can be easily and visually compared across multiple assemblages. Our evenness indices satisfy all the requirements presented in this paper and encompass many widely used evenness measures as special cases. When there are multiple assemblages, the abundance‐based Jaccard‐ and S{\o}rensen‐type dissimilarity measures (which are monotonic functions of beta diversity) can be expressed as weighted averages of the individual species' compositional unevenness values; here each individual species' compositional unevenness is calculated based on that species' abundances among assemblages. The contribution of a species to each dissimilarity measure can be clearly disentangled and quantified in terms of this single species' compositional unevenness among assemblages. Thus, our framework links among the concepts of evenness, diversity, beta diversity and similarity. Moreover, the framework can be readily extended to a phylogenetic version. A real data example is used to illustrate our approach. We also discuss some criteria and other measures that were previously proposed in the literature.},

@article{Chao2019b,
abstract = {Based on the framework of attribute diversity (a generalization of Hill numbers of order q), we develop a class of functional diversity measures sensitive not only to species abundances but also to trait‐based species‐pairwise functional distances. The new method refines and improves on the conventional species‐equivalent approach in three areas: (i) the conventional method often gives similar values (close to unity) to assemblages with contrasting levels of functional diversity; (ii) when a distance metric is unbounded, the conventional functional diversity depends on the presence/absence of other assemblages in the study; (iii) in partitioning functional gamma diversity into alpha and beta components, the conventional gamma is sometimes less than alpha. To resolve these issues, we add to the attribute‐diversity framework a novel concept: $\tau$ ‐ the threshold of functional distinctiveness between any two species; here $\tau$ can be chosen to be any positive value. Any two species with functional distance ≥ $\tau$ are treated as functionally equally‐distinct. Our functional diversity quantifies the effective number of functionally equally‐distinct species (or “virtual functional groups”) with all pairwise distances at least $\tau$ for different‐species pairs. We advocate the use of two complementary diversity profiles ($\tau$‐profile and q‐profile), which depict functional diversity with varying levels of $\tau$ and q, respectively. Both the conventional species‐equivalent method (i.e., $\tau$ = the maximum of species‐pairwise distances) and classic taxonomic diversity (i.e., $\tau$ = the minimum of non‐zero species‐pairwise distances) are incorporated into our proposed $\tau$‐profile. For any type of species‐pairwise distance matrices, our attribute‐diversity approach allows proper diversity partitioning, with the desired property gamma≥alpha and thus avoids all the restrictions that apply to the conventional diversity decomposition. Our functional alpha and gamma are interpreted as the effective numbers of functionally equally‐distinct species, respectively, in an assemblage and in the pooled assemblage, while beta is the effective number of equally‐large assemblages with no shared species and all species in the assemblages being equally‐distinct. The resulting beta diversity can be transformed to obtain abundance‐sensitive S{\o}rensen‐ and Jaccard‐type functional (dis)similarity profiles. Hypothetical and real examples are used to illustrate the framework. Online software and R codes are available to facilitate computations. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {There is little consensus about how natural (e.g. productivity, disturbance) and anthropogenic (e.g. invasive species, habitat destruction) ecological drivers influence biodiversity. Here, we show that when sampling is standardised by area (species density) or individuals (rarefied species richness), the measured effect sizes depend critically on the spatial grain and extent of sampling, as well as the size of the species pool. This compromises comparisons of effects sizes within studies using standard statistics, as well as among studies using meta-analysis. To derive an unambiguous effect size, we advocate that comparisons need to be made on a scale-independent metric, such as Hurlbert's Probability of Interspecific Encounter. Analyses of this metric can be used to disentangle the relative influence of changes in the absolute and relative abundances of individuals, as well as their intraspecific aggregations, in driving differences in biodiversity among communities. This and related approaches are necessary to achieve generality in understanding how biodiversity responds to ecological drivers and will necessitate a change in the way many ecologists collect and analyse their data.},

@article{Dauby2012,
abstract = {A theoretical framework based on Hill numbers has recently been advocated to measure and partition diversity sensu stricto. Hill numbers can be interpreted intuitively as effective number of species (ENS). They conform to the so-called replication principle allowing a mathematically coherent multiplicative partitioning of diversity. They form a family of ENS defined by the parameter q which controls the weight attributed to rare species. Despite its advantages, this framework was developed without considering its robustness when treating community samples. In this study, we first show that Hurlbert diversity indices (expected number of species among k individuals) can be transformed into ENS that conform asymptotically to the replication principle while controlling the weight given to rare species through parameter k. We investigate the statistical properties of Hill and Hurlbert ENS using simulated communities with contrasted diversity. The properties of multiplicative beta diversity estimators based on ENS are also characterized by simulating communities with different levels of differentiation. We show that Hurlbert ENS provides a better statistical performance than Hill numbers when dealing with small sample sizes. By contrast, Hill numbers and their estimators suffer from substantial bias except when rare species have a low weight (q= 2). An estimator of ENS estimating both Hill numbers for q= 2 and Hurlbert ENS for k= 2 is shown to give the best performance and is recommended for processing real datasets when rare species receive low weight. In order to better take account of rare species, current estimators of Hill numbers are not recommended when sample size is too low while Hurlbert's ENS performs reliably. In conclusion, while Hill numbers possess some interesting mathematical properties that are not shared by Hurlbert's ENS, the latter outperforms Hill numbers in terms of statistical properties and is well suited to processing community samples, as illustrated on a real dataset. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

Nonetheless, at global scales, we do not know what fraction of biodiversity consists of rare species. Here, we present the largest compilation of global plant diversity to quantify the fraction of Earth's plant biodiversity that are rare. A large fraction, $\sim$36.5% of Earth's $\sim$435,000 plant species, are exceedingly rare. Sampling biases and prominent models, such as neutral theory and the k-niche model, cannot account for the observed prevalence of rarity. Our results indicate that (i) climatically more stable regions have harbored rare species and hence a large fraction of Earth's plant species via reduced extinction risk but that (ii) climate change and human land use are now disproportionately impacting rare species. Estimates of global species abundance distributions have important implications for risk assessments and conservation planning in this era of rapid global change.},

abstract = {Abstract Aim The species abundance distribution (SAD) is a fundamental pattern in macroecology. Understanding how SADs vary spatially, and identifying the variables that drive any change, is important from a theoretical perspective because it enables greater understanding of the factors that underpin the relative abundance of species. However, precise knowledge on how the form of SADs varies across large (continental) scales is limited. Here, we use the shape parameter of the gambin distribution to assess how meta-community-scale SAD shape varies spatially as a function of various climatic variables and dataset characteristics. Location Eastern North America (ENA). Time period Present day. Major taxa studied Trees. Methods Using an extensive continental-scale dataset of 863,930 individual trees in plots across ENA sampled using a standardized method, we use a spatial regression framework to examine the effect of temperature and precipitation on the form of the SAD. We also assess whether the prevalence of multimodality in the SAD varies spatially across ENA as a function of temperature and precipitation, in addition to other sample characteristics. Results We found that temperature, precipitation and species richness can explain two-thirds of the variation in tree SAD form across ENA. Temperature had the largest effect on SAD shape, and it was found that increasing temperature resulted in more logseries-like SAD shapes (i.e. SADs with a relatively higher proportion of rarer species). We also found spatial variation in SAD multimodality as a function of temperature and species richness. Main conclusions Our results indicate that temperature is a key environmental driver governing the form of ENA tree meta-community-scale SADs. This finding has implications for our understanding of local-scale variation in tree abundance and suggests that niche factors and environmental filtering are important in the structuring of ENA tree communities at larger scales.},

abstract = {1.Estimating biodiversity and its change in space and time poses serious methodological challenges. First, there has been a long debate on how to quantify biodiversity, and second, measurements of biodiversity and its change are scale-dependent. Therefore, comparisons of biodiversity metrics between communities are ideally carried out across scales. Simulations can be used to study the behaviour of biodiversity metrics across scales, but most approaches are system specific, plagued by large parameter spaces, and therefore cumbersome to use and interpret. However, realistic spatial biodiversity patterns can be generated without reference to ecological processes, which suggests a simple simulation framework as important tool for ecologists. 2.Here, we present the R package mobsim that allows users to simulate the abundances and the distributions of individuals of different species in a spatially explicit landscape. Users can define key properties of communities, including the total number of individuals, the species abundance distribution (SAD), and the degree of intraspecific spatial aggregation. Furthermore, the package provides functions that derive biodiversity measures, such as rarefaction curves and species-area relationships (SAR), from simulated communities, or from observed data, as well as functions that simulate different sampling designs. 3.We show several example applications of the package. First, we illustrate how species rarefaction and accumulation curves can be used to disentangle changes in the fundamental components that underlie biodiversity: (i) total abundance, (ii) species abundance distribution, (iii) and species aggregation. Second, we demonstrate how mobsim can be applied to assess the performance of species-richness estimators. The latter indicates how spatial aggregation challenges classical non-spatial species-richness estimators. 4.mobsim allows the simulation and analysis of a large range of biodiversity scenarios and sampling designs in a comprehensive way by directly manipulating key community properties. The simplicity and control provided by the package also makes it a useful didactic tool. The combination of controlled simulations and their analysis will facilitate a more rigorous interpretation of real world data that exhibit sampling effects and scale-dependence.},
